Welcome to Koha Curios. I work with Koha mainly from the side of migrating libraries from a legacy ILS to Koha. In the course of that I touch on system administration, code and customization as well as my data work. The purpose of this blog is not to be a comprehensive or authoritative source of information but to share random tidbits I don't have anywhere else to share.  Additionally, I will mirror here some content I will also be posting to the Koha community wiki where appropriate.

If there are any topics people are interested in feel free to submit it as an issue along with the normal spate of typos I may make.
